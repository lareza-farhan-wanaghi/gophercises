## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) exercises. As a challenge, all codes are written with my own ideas without viewing the tutorial videos.


### Folder details

**1. quiz**

Solution for the 1st exercise. Activities involved: making several functions to read CSV files & flags, listen to user inputs, and simulate a timer. [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz)


**2. urlshort**

Solution for the 2nd exercise. Activities involved: making a simple HTTP listener & its handlers, which can also establish a Postgres database connection, and creating functions to read & parse JSON/YAML files. [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort)


**3. cyoa**

Solution for the 3rd exercise. Activities involved: creating go template files & the functions to parse them and an HTTP handler that renders the parsed go templates. [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/cyoa)


**4. link**

Solution for the 4th exercise. Activities involved: creating functions to parse an HTML file and collect the href values & inner texts of all "a" tags within the specified HTML file and starting to write test functions (which will keep doing in the upcoming exercise). [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/link)


**5. sitemap**

Solution for the 5th exercise. Activities involved: creating functions to crawl all reachable same-domain URLs from a specific URL, which runs asynchronously with the help of mutex and wait-group structs, and turn them into a sitemap XML, implementing regex match & searching. [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/link)


**6. hr1**

Solution for the 6th exercise. Activities involved: creating solutions for the caesarchiper and camelcase hacker rank problems, which play with the string and rune data types. [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/hr1)


**7. task**

Solution for the 7th exercise. Activities involved: creating a CLI to-do task manager program with cobra library that stores and retrieve data in a boltDB database. [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/task)


**8. phone**

Solution for the 8th exercise. Activities involved: creating more robust functions to interact with a PostgreSQL database, which does queries and alters a table, and a program to normalize phone number data. [Learn more](https://github.com/gophercises/phone)


**9. deck**

Solution for the 9th exercise. Activities involved: creating structs and functions to simulate objects in a card game, making a function that applies the functional-ops coding pattern, and using stringer with go-generate to work with enum-like objects.
